1. Live feed directly from PAG-ASA that notifies individuals of oncoming weather based disasters
2. A method for victims to indicate that they need help, which will be stored and indicated in a map system for rescue reference.
3. Guidelines for what actions to take once a disaster is announced, during a disaster and after a disaster.
4. Display locations of relief centers and establishments where victims can proceed to attain aid.
